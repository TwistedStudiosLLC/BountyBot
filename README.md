# BountyBot
A [Discord](https://discordapp.com) Bounty Bot originally designed for [TurtleCoin](https://turtlecoin.lol) written in node.js
The Bot has since evolved into a multi-server Bot capable of handling a complete line of settings, custom command prefix, and a custom subdomain on ```DOMAIN COMING SOON```

This BountyBot can be used for other servers easily!
